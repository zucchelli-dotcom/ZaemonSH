#	Carbon Copy Clone - Check Currency
#	by Jedda Wignall
#	http://jedda.me

#	v1.0 - 2 Jul 2012
#	Initial release.

#	This script has 2 modes:
#	• Can be used as a post-clone script in Carbon Copy Cloner to mark a destination as successful
#	• Can be used as a Nagios plugin to check the time of the last successful clone to a destination

#	--- In Carbon Copy Cloner (CCC) ---
#	Simply set the script as the post-clone shell script (After copying files...) for your scheduled clone. 
#	More information can be found at my original blog post about this script (http://jedda.me/2012/07/checking-carbon-copy-cloner-nagios/)
# 	or the documentation on this feature in CCC (http://www.bombich.com/software/docs/CCC/en.lproj/scheduling/performing-actions-before-and-after-the-backup-task.html)

#	--- In Nagios ---
#	This script checks .ccc_clone_last_completed file on a volume, and reports if a clone has completed successfully within a number of minutes of the current time.
#	Takes two arguments (clone destination, warning threshold in minutes):
#	./check_ccc_currency.sh -d '/Volumes/Boot-Clone' -w 1440
