MSG=$(gettext 'nexthop: Match against the next-hop domain, which is either the
\trecipient domain, or the transport next-hop configured for the
\tdomain stripped of any optional socket type prefix, enclosing
\tsquare brackets and trailing port. When MX lookups are not
\tsuppressed, this is the original nexthop domain prior to the MX
\tlookup, not the result of the MX lookup. For LMTP delivery via
\tUNIX-domain sockets, the verified next-hop name is $myhostname.
\tThis strategy is suitable for use with the "secure" policy. Case
\tis ignored.

dot-nexthop: As above, but match server certificate names that are
\tsubdomains of the next-hop domain. Case is ignored.

hostname: Match against the hostname of the server, often obtained
\tvia an unauthenticated DNS MX lookup. For LMTP delivery via
\tUNIX-domain sockets, the verified name is $myhostname. This
\tmatches the verification strategy of the "MUST" keyword in the
\tobsolete smtp_tls_per_site table, and is suitable for use with
\tthe "verify" security level. When the next-hop name is enclosed
\tin square brackets to suppress MX lookups, the "hostname"
\tstrategy is the same as the "nexthop" strategy. Case is ignored.
