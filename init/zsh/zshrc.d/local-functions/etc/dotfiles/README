Put one or more of these lines in your ~/.coot file:

(load (append-dir-file (getenv "ZDOT") "zshrc.d/local-functions/etc/dotfiles/coot_custom_menu.scm"))

;; ## Note that cootrc_powermate_and_keybindings.scm is read into the coot_custom_menu.scm

(load (append-dir-file (getenv "ZDOT") "zshrc.d/local-functions/etc/dotfiles/coot_zalman.scm"))


Put one or more of these lines in your ~/.pymolrc file:


@ $ZDOT/zshrc.d/local-functions/etc/dotfiles/pymolrc_aliases.pml   
@ $ZDOT/zshrc.d/local-functions/etc/dotfiles/pymolrc_powermate.pml

The $ZDOT will cause problems for double-clicked pymol files.  Either replace this with
the actual value of $ZDOT (eg: /Library/init/zsh) or else edit the file 
.MacOSX/environment.plist and add the lines


    <key>ZDOT</key>
    <string>/Library/init/zsh</string>
