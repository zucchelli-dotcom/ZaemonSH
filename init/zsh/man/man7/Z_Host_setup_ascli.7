\- Customize completions that use the _hosts completion with a CLI assistant

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B Z_Host_setup_ascli


.SH DESCRIPTION  

.B Z_Host_setup_ascli
generates a CLI assistant to enable the user to easily configure the zsh completion system for completions that use a list of hostnames. Choices are presented that permit the user to chose from what is generated by zsh by default (from the /etc/hosts file), or to define a customized set of hosts.  (As a starting point, the customization list displays the hosts found in the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file, but any names can be added or deleted.).
