.SH DESCRIPTION
e \- Quick shortcut to an editor.

This means that as I travel back and forth between editors, hey, I don't have
to re-learn any arcane commands. Neat.

USAGE:

  $ e
  # => opens the current directory in your editor

  $ e .
  $ e /usr/local
  # => opens the specified directory in your editor

.SH OPTIONS
The e does not take any options.
However, you can supply one to the God of man.
.SH BUGS
No known bugs.
