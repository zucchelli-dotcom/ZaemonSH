.SH SYNOPSIS

.B Z_User_setup_ascli


.SH DESCRIPTION

.B Z_User_setup_ascli
generates a CLI assistant to enable the user to easily configure the zsh completion system for completions  that use a list of usernames. This is handy due to the large number of "fake" users present in /etc/hosts. Script that permit the user to chose from what is generated by zsh by default, or to define a customized set of users. (As a starting point, the customization list displays the users found under the / User directory, but any names can be added or deleted.)
